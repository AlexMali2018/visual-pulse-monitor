INSTALLING OPEN CV FACE DETECTION IN MATLAB PACKAGE

This assumes *nix compilation, and has only been tested on OS X Lion.

1a.
Install OpenCV 2+ via homebrew or otherwise.
Your OpenCV header files should be located at /usr/local/include/opencv
and /usr/local/include/opencv2

1b.
Copy the trained face detection cascade included in OpenCV,
haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml, to this directory

2.
Download Open CV Viola-Jones Face Detection in Matlab (by Sreekar Krishna)
mex function from MatlabCentral File Exchange:
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/19912

3.
Edit FaceDetect.cpp to replace
#include "cv.h" with #include "opencv/cv.h"

to take advantage of OpenCV 2 backwards-compatibility.

4.
Compile mex function (after running mex -setup for your platform):

mex src/FaceDetect.cpp -I/usr/local/include -lopencv_core -lopencv_imgproc ...
-lopencv_objdetect

and include it in this directory.
